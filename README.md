> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before moving on from section make sure you understand exactly what was covered. Take a break, review the code that is written, review you notes, review the project that was built, and maybe write some code with yourself.

> [!NOTE]
> Before diving deep in react world, we should see how the things are oranized in react containig folder. So here is the [link](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/first-react-app-advice-dcg5mf) in Cloud based IDE where you can check out the react related things without knowing what is written and how it is written just to be curious of all learning in the coming sections.
